Matlab code for my thesis. No warranty whatsoever is given. The code may not even work. You can figure it out though. :)

The two main functions are af.m, which computes the ambiguity function, and makesignal.m, that generates the signal to pass to the 
AF function. Most of the other files generate the plots used in the thesis. 

Another set of files are those with "opti" in their name. They evaluate the optimizations for the Kaiser window and NLFM waveform. 
Some of those, the ones ending in "_gen" just generate the data, which usually takes a long time, and saves them to a .mat file. That way,
they can easily be plotted later without repeating the calculations.

Hope it benefits someone.
